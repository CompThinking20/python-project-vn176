#This process getting to this point has been long and grueling to say the least
#Although i did not do milestone 1 fully correctly, the process was still difficult for me
# Before I could even start milesstone 1 i had to download jupiter lab because it was most comfortbale for me
# After that I watched the video on input like 3-4 times to gain better understanding
# with Milestone 2 i was alot better prepared i met with the Professor and i learned the right way
# The most impactful lectures with helping to complete this proj was the input lecture and  the blaseball proj.
```


```python
# You said i needed a function that actually worked, so I defined a function that actually worked.
# Defining the function1 helped my proj to go smoothly, prior to the function i was doin things manually.
